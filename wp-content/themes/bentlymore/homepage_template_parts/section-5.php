			<h2>Compensation in Personal Injury Claims </h2>

<p>Plaintiffs in personal injury lawsuits can recover various types of compensation depending on the damages in the case. The plaintiff’s attorney will provide the court with evidence showing the extent of the plaintiff’s damages. Damages in personal injury cases usually include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Medical expenses.</strong> This includes ambulance fees, hospital bills, and any costs for necessary treatments or ongoing care.</li>

<li><strong>Lost income.</strong> A plaintiff’s injuries may prevent him or her from returning to work for an extended time. The plaintiff can sue for those lost wages and the wages he or she would have reasonably expected to earn in the future if the injuries prevent the plaintiff from returning to work at all.</li>

<li><strong>Property damage.</strong> If a defendant’s actions caused any damage to the plaintiff’s private property, he or she may sue for the costs of repairing or replacing that property.</li>

<li><strong>Pain and suffering.</strong> A judge will consider expert witness testimony and award the plaintiff an appropriate amount. </li>

</ul>
